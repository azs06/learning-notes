#### SQL Notes
This is my personal notes to better understand and learn sql

- RDBMS is a relational database management system.
- On PostgreSQL command line client(psql) you can run meta command using the `\command` format
    for example `\q` quits the interactive shell;
- SQL statements must end with a semi colon;
